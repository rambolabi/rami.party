   Breachlight — data-logs.js
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The evidence layer. Two catalogues:

     BL_LOG_SOURCES  which log holds what, how long, and how to export it.
     BL_AUDIT_OPS    the operations worth reacting to, what each one means,
                     and what to do the moment you see it.

   BL_AUDIT_OPS is the single source of truth for BOTH:
     • the "an audit event fired" lookup page in the site, and
     • the detection rules in the Logscope tool (logscope/rules.js).
   Add an operation here and both places gain it.

   Matching contract used by the tool
     op      canonical operation string, matched case-insensitively
     aka[]   alternative strings that mean the same thing (Entra vs Purview vs
             Exchange cmdlet naming). Matched the same way.       keys    search keywords for the SITE only — never used for matching, so
               it is safe to put natural-language phrasing here.     match   'exact' (default) | 'starts' | 'contains'
             Use 'contains' sparingly — a loose match produces noise, and a
             noisy rule gets muted, which is worse than no rule.
