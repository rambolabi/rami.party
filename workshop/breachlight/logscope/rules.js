   The detections. Two kinds:

     event rules      look at one normalised event at a time
     aggregate rules  look at the whole set, for things a single row cannot
                      show — spray patterns, impossible travel, bulk download

   Most audit and Purview detections are generated from BL_AUDIT_OPS in
   ../data-logs.js, so the tool and the site can never disagree about what an
   operation means or what to do about it. Add an operation there and it
   appears here automatically.

   Exposes window.LS_RULES.
