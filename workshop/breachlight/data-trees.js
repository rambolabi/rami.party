   Breachlight — data-trees.js
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Interactive triage. These exist for the reader who is frightened, does not
   know what has happened, and cannot afford to browse a menu.

   Schema
     id, aud, title, glyph, lede, keys, start
     nodes{}  each node is EITHER a question or a result
       question: { q, hint?, options: [{ a, to, note? }] }
       result:   { result, tag, steps[], link?, note? }

   Rules
     • Every option must point at a node that exists.
     • Every path must terminate in a result. No loops.
     • Results are short. They say what to do in the next sixty seconds and
       then hand off to a playbook — a tree is a router, never a replacement.
     • Run BL.audit() in the console; it enforces all of the above.
