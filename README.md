# Rami.party - Digital Playground

This is a demo/test domain for experimental projects. 

## What is this?

A place where websites are born, tested, and sometimes mysteriously disappear into the digital void.

## Warning

⚠️ This is a test environment. Things may:
- Break without notice
- Move unexpectedly
- Achieve sentience
- Return interesting HTTP status codes

## Movie Quote Philosophy

We believe in coding by famous movie quotes:
- "Houston, we have a problem" - Every deployment
- "Life finds a way" - Just like bugs in production
- "I'll be back" - Every 500 error
- "These aren't the domains you're looking for" - Obi-Wan's wisdom
