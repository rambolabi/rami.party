# The Three Laws of Robotics (as interpreted by web crawlers)
#
# First Law: A robot may not injure a website or, through inaction,
# allow a website to come to harm by crawling too aggressively.
#
# Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given in this file,
# except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
#
# Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such
# protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
